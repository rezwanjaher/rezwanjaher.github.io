		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>
			I received my B.Sc. in Industrial and Production Engineering (IPE) from 
			<a href="https://www.sust.edu/" target="_blank">Shahjalal University of Science and Technology</a>.
			SUST IPE started its journey in 1994 as the country's first-ever Industrial and Production Engineering program.
			Recognized as one of the most rigorous and prestigious engineering programs in Bangladesh, SUST's IPE curriculum blends technical,
			managerial, and interdisciplinary approaches to industrial engineering. This solid foundation has equipped me with
			the skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges in a fast-paced industry like the RMG industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			 My undergraduate thesis, titled 
			<em>“A Simulation Study of Bio-Heat Transfer in Human Skin Under Different Burning Conditions”</em>, provided an 
			opportunity to explore these interests further. My undergraduate supervisor was Professor 
			<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HOOJPRYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Abul Mukid Md. Mukaddes</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I completed my secondary and higher secondary education at Cumilla Zilla School and Dhaka Residential Model School 
			and College, achieving the highest grade (GPA 5/5) in both institutions.

  <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I have more than five years of experience in Bangladesh's most thriving Ready-Made Garments industry.
    I have started as an Industrial Engineer and later promoted to an Assistant Manager in the IE and Planning division at SIMFTEX Apparel & Washing Ltd. I led multiple teams addressing complex operational issues in the fast-paced RMG industry. I have taken initiatives to optimize production floors and implement continuous improvement through KAIZEN principles. My role involved conducting capacity analysis, addressing production bottlenecks, and using machine learning for inventory forecasting to reduce stock-outs.

  <h2>Freelance Experience</h2>
  <p>
    While working full-time during the day, I took on freelance data science projects at night especially during the COVID-19 period, honing my skills in data analysis and optimization. This role allowed me to apply tools such as Python, R, and libraries like Pandas and NumPy to analyze large datasets and provide actionable insights for clients across diverse industries. I developed expertise in statistical modeling, data visualization, and predictive analysis, empowering clients to make informed business decisions.

  <h2>Career Plan</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently aspiring to pursue an MS degree to re-engage with the academic environment that I have deeply missed. Following my MS, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to deepen my expertise in operations research, simulation, and healthcare optimization. My long-term goal is to work with government agencies and research institutions, contributing to the design and implementation of next-generation healthcare facilities. By applying advanced data analytics, stochastic modeling, and simulation techniques, I aim to address critical issues such as resource allocation, patient flow, and operational efficiency in healthcare systems, especially during emergencies. I am committed to developing innovative, data-driven solutions that can improve access to healthcare and optimize facility planning, ultimately supporting more resilient and effective public health infrastructure.
