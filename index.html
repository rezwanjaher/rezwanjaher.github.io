        <h1>Welcome to Md. Rezwan Jaher's Homepage</h1></br>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Md. Rezwan Jaher. I received my BSc in Industrial and Production Engineering (IPE) from 
			<a href="https://www.sust.edu/" target="_blank">Shahjalal University of Science and Technology</a> (SUST).
			SUST IPE started its journey in 1994 as the country's first-ever Industrial and Production Engineering program.
			Recognized as one of the most rigorous engineering programs in Bangladesh, SUST's IPE curriculum blends technical,
			managerial, and interdisciplinary approaches to industrial engineering. This solid foundation has equipped me with
			the skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges in both manufacturing and service industries.
		</p>
		<p>
			During my time at SUST, I developed a passion for solving real-world problems, particularly through my work as an 
			undergraduate research assistant. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, 
			deepening my interest in simulation, operations research, and process optimization. My undergraduate thesis, titled 
			<em>“A Simulation Study of Bio-Heat Transfer in Human Skin Under Different Burning Conditions”</em>, provided an 
			opportunity to explore these interests further. My undergraduate advisor was Professor 
			<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HOOJPRYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Abul Mukid Md. Mukaddes</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I completed my secondary and higher secondary education at Cumilla Zilla School and Dhaka Residential Model School 
			and College, achieving the highest grade (GPA 5/5) in both institutions.

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My research focuses on Finite Element Method (FEM), computer simulation, queuing theory, and stochastic simulation. I aim to expand my knowledge in healthcare optimization and biomedical simulation, which I first explored during my undergraduate research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working on a paper investigating the effects of surface-to-surface radiation heat transfer in the human eye and the impact of various safety glasses using FEM and simulation.

            <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working as an Assistant Manager at SIMFTEX Apparel & Washing Ltd., working with a multidisciplinary team to support business decisions. This role has strengthened my time management and team leadership skills. Previously, I worked as a freelance data scientist, where I enjoyed finding patterns and trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I’ve gained valuable experience in different sectors, I miss the academic environment and the excitement of tackling challenging projects and discovering new ideas.
